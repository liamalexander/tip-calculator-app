## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add 2 types of event listener to the document by adding them into an array and then using the forEach method on them to listen to the document as a whole.

It was also the first time I properly used HTML datasets and I found this very useful.

### Continued development

I would like to continue working on responsive design and getting the design to look perfect on all devices.  I would also like to continue to improve my design skills in general and work more with datasets.
